//! The registration window: the one time a pool client may register host memory.
//!
//! Registering host memory with the GPU consumes device memory, which a serving
//! instance must not do. So a client attaches to the manager's memory once, at
//! startup, and the window closes: either the first attach finished (and
//! [`super::engine::Engine::close_registration`] then makes the registrar refuse
//! everything), or the manager was not reached in time and the client runs on its
//! local tiers for the life of the process.
